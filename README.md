# saz2js

A utility to convert fiddler capture (`.saz`) to js object.

The code is inspired by [node-saz-parser](https://github.com/ludoviclefevre/node-saz-parser), updated to use [yauzl](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/yauzl) instead of `unzip`.

## Usage

1. install the package `npm i saz2js`
2. sample script

```javascript
// sample output
```

That's it, really!
